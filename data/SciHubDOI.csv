Besides the primary product, 1‐dodecanol, the conversion of dodecane yielded dodecanoic, 12‐hydroxydodecanoic, and 1,12‐dodecanedioic acids, as identified by GC–MS. Dodecanal could be detected only in trace amounts, and 1,12‐dodecanediol was not observed, thus suggesting that dodecanoic acid is the branch point between mono‐ and diterminal hydroxylation. Simultaneously, oxygenation was observed at other hydrocarbon chain positions (preferentially C2 and C11). Similar results were observed in reactions of tetradecane.

For symptomatic readers, texts possess meanings that are veiled, latent, all but absent if it were not for their irrepressible and recurring symptoms. Noting the recent trend away from ideological demystification, this essay proposes various modes of ""surface reading"" that together strive to accurately depict the truth to which a text bears witness. Surface reading broadens the scope of critique to include the kinds of interpretive activity that seek to understand the complexity of literary surfaces---surfaces that have been rendered invisible by symptomatic reading.","2009-11-01","2025-04-14 18:35:59","2025-04-14 18:35:59","2025-04-14 18:35:59","1-21","","1","108","","","Surface Reading","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The primary recrystallization microstructure and texture provide the prerequisites for nucleation and abnormal grain growth of secondary Goss grains. The dispersedly distributed Goss grains do not exhibit an evident advantage in grain size and number, and the normal grain growth of matrix grains can be inhibited by low-angle grain boundaries before onset of secondary recrystallization.

However, exercise also increases mitochondrial formation of presumably harmful reactive oxygen species (ROS). Antioxidants are widely used as supplements but whether they affect the health-promoting effects of exercise is unknown. We evaluated the effects of a combination of vitamin C (1000 mg/day) and vitamin E (400 IU/day) on insulin sensitivity as measured by glucose infusion rates (GIR) during a hyperinsulinemic, euglycemic clamp in previously untrained (               n               = 19) and pretrained (               n               = 20) healthy young men. Before and after a 4 week intervention of physical exercise, GIR was determined, and muscle biopsies for gene expression analyses as well as plasma samples were obtained to compare changes over baseline and potential influences of vitamins on exercise effects. Exercise increased parameters of insulin sensitivity (GIR and plasma adiponectin) only in the absence of antioxidants in both previously untrained (               P               < 0.001) and pretrained (               P               < 0.001) individuals. This was paralleled by increased expression of ROS-sensitive transcriptional regulators of insulin sensitivity and ROS defense capacity, peroxisome-proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ), and PPARγ coactivators PGC1α and PGC1β only in the absence of antioxidants (               P               < 0.001 for all). Molecular mediators of endogenous ROS defense (superoxide dismutases 1 and 2; glutathione peroxidase) were also induced by exercise, and this effect too was blocked by antioxidant supplementation. Consistent with the concept of mitohormesis, exercise-induced oxidative stress ameliorates insulin resistance and causes an adaptive response promoting endogenous antioxidant defense capacity. Supplementation with antioxidants may preclude these health-promoting effects of exercise in humans.","2009-05-26","2025-04-14 18:36:05","2025-04-14 18:36:05","2025-04-14 18:36:05","8665-8670","","21","106","","Proc.

Annually resolved and absolutely dated temperature proxies south of the European Alps that extend back into medieval times are, however, mainly limited to measurements of maximum latewood density (MXD) from high-elevation conifers. Here, the authors present the world’s best replicated MXD site chronology of 414 living and relict Pinus uncinata trees found >2200 m above mean sea level (MSL) in the Spanish central Pyrenees. This composite record correlates significantly ( p ≤ 0.01) with May–June and August–September mean temperatures over most of the Iberian Peninsula and northern Africa ( r = 0.72; 1950–2014). Spanning the period 1186–2014 of the Common Era (CE), the new reconstruction reveals overall warmer conditions around 1200 and 1400, and again after around 1850. The coldest reconstructed summer in 1258 (−4.4°C compared to 1961–90) followed the largest known volcanic eruption of the CE. The twentieth century is characterized by pronounced summer cooling in the 1970s, subsequently rising temperatures until 2003, and a slowdown of warming afterward. Little agreement is found with climate model simulations that consistently overestimate recent summer warming and underestimate preindustrial temperature changes. Interannual–multidecadal covariability with regional hydroclimate includes summer pluvials after large volcanic eruptions. This study demonstrates the relevance of updating MXD-based temperature reconstructions, not only back in time but also toward the present, and emphasizes the importance of comparing temperature and hydroclimatic proxies, as well as model simulations for understanding regional climate dynamics.","2017-07","2025-04-14 18:36:07","2025-04-14 18:36:07","2025-04-14 18:36:07","5295-5318","","14","30","","J.

Thus, polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) are liberated. Free PUFAs react with molecular oxygen to give lipid hydroperoxide molecules (LOOHs). In case of severe cell injury, this physiological reaction switches to the generation of lipid peroxide radicals (LOO               .               ). These radicals can attack nearly all biomolecules such as lipids, carbohydrates, proteins, nucleic acids and enzymes, impairing their biological functions. Identical cell responses are triggered by manipulation of food, for example, heating/grilling and particularly homogenization, representing cell injury. Cholesterol as well as diets rich in saturated fat have been postulated to accelerate the risk of atherosclerosis while food rich in unsaturated fatty acids has been claimed to lower this risk. However, the fact is that LOO               .               radicals generated from PUFAs can oxidize cholesterol to toxic cholesterol oxides, simulating a reduction in cholesterol level. In this review it is shown how active LOO               .               radicals interact with biomolecules at a speed transcending usual molecule–molecule reactions by several orders of magnitude. Here, it is explained how functional groups are fundamentally transformed by an attack of LOO               .               with an obliteration of essential biomolecules leading to pathological conditions. A serious reconsideration of the health and diet guidelines is required.","2014-11-10","2025-04-14 18:36:14","2025-04-14 18:36:14","2025-04-14 18:36:14","14928-14945","","46","20","","Chemistry A European J","","","","","","","","en","http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/termsAndConditions#vor","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The organic gelators self-assembled to form 3D fibrillar structures with very high porosity in the electrolyte solvent. Thermal stability of the gel electrolyte increased with the length of side chain and concentration of gelators. When the side chain length of gelator was 22 carbons, the gel electrolyte could endure temperature higher than 60 °C with the addition 2 wt% gelator. The most prominent advantage of gel electrolyte over liquid electrolyte was that it could broaden the electrochemical stable window, which has potential application in high voltage lithium ion batteries. With the addition of organic gelator, conductivity of the gel electrolyte would decrease a little, but it still showed the conductivity–temperature behavior of liquid electrolyte. The cells with gel electrolyte showed similar cycling performance as those with liquid electrolyte, which indicated that the organic gelators of glutamic acid derivatives could be used in lithium ion batteries, especially in high voltage lithium ion batteries.","2016","2025-04-14 18:36:19","2025-04-14 18:36:19","2025-04-14 18:36:19","88820-88825","","91","6","","RSC Adv.","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although such an approach seems to be promising and innovative, researchers have indicated several problems when applying it to practical applications, in particular, the lack of proper strategies or tools to assist the students to learn collaboratively in such a learning scenario with abundant content. Students might feel interested when using the mobile devices to learn; however, without proper assistance or guidance, their learning achievements are usually disappointing. To cope with this problem, this study proposes a concept map‐oriented Mindtool for collaborative ubiquitous learning. Experimental results from a natural science course in an elementary school show that this approach not only enhances learning motivation but also improves the learning achievements of the students.","2011-09","2025-04-14 18:36:30","2025-04-14 18:36:30","2025-04-14 18:36:29","778-789","","5","42","","Brit J Educational Tech","","","","","","","","en","http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/termsAndConditions#vor","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although composting is promoted by state agencies for many materials, a notable exception is invasive plants due to concerns about spreading propagules with the finished product. To address this issue, we measured the viability of garlic mustard and common buckthorn seeds exposed to turned or static composting methods. Piles were built in 2012 and 2013, and seeds from both species were inserted and monitored for viability. Seed viability was reduced rapidly regardless of year, composting method, or species. Viability of seeds was zero within 7 and 15 d of composting for garlic mustard and common buckthorn, respectively, in both years. Results indicate that composting facilities are able to render the seeds of these invasive plants nonviable using either composting method because inactivation is within the composting timeframes typically practiced by the industry. This includes the process to further reduce pathogens (PFRP) with thresholds of 55 C for 15 d for the compost management process used for this trial.","2015-09","2025-04-14 18:37:03","2025-04-14 18:37:03","2025-04-14 18:37:03","284-291","","3","8","","Invasive plant sci. manag.","","","","","","","","en","https://www.cambridge.org/core/terms","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The present study was undertaken to investigate the effect of different               N. sativa               seed extracts on insulin secretion. Different fractions of the seed were prepared: the defatted fraction (HR II), which was divided into two subfractions: the first (HR III) containing acidic and neutral compounds and the second (HR IV) containing basic compounds. The insulin secretory effects of these extracts were evaluated individually at different concentrations (0.01, 0.1, 1 and 5 mg/mL), in vitro in isolated rat pancreatic islets in the presence of 8.3 mmol/L glucose. The results show that addition of the defatted whole extract or of the basic subfraction of the seed in the incubation medium significantly increased glucose‐induced insulin release from the islets. In the case of the acidic and neutral subfraction, the stimulatory effect was observed only for the higher concentration (5 mg/mL). However, a clear concentration‐dependent increase in insulin release from isolated pancreatic islets was observed for the basic subfraction. Our data show that the antidiabetic properties of               N. sativa               seeds may be, at least partly, mediated by stimulated insulin release, and that the basic subfraction largely contributes to this stimulatory effect. Further phytochemical studies are underway in order to isolate the pharmacological compound(s) responsible for the insulinotropic effect of               N. sativa               seeds.","2004-10","2025-04-14 18:37:05","2025-04-14 18:37:05","2025-04-14 18:37:05","525-529","","5","18","","Fundamemntal Clinical Pharma","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Uniaxial tensile tests were performed on styrene‐butadiene‐styrene block copolymers. The three polymers, having polystyrene (PS) fractions 0.27, 0.29, and 0.48, also represented three molecular weights (0.49, 0.58, and 1.0 × 10               5               ). Specimens were prepared by casting from three solvents (methyl ethyl ketone, MEK; cyclohexane; and a 9:1 mixture of tetrahydrofuran and MEK). This wide range of variables led to a correspondingly wide spectrum of properties, including the “plastic‐to‐rubber” transition in some cases. Stress‐strain curves were characterized by modulus, yield stress, general elevation, and fracture stress and elongation. Results were interpreted in terms of microstructural parameters obtained from the earlier linear tests, including interphase properties, and molecular features as well. Special insight emerged from comparison of first‐cycle (to 300 percent elongation) and second‐cycle tests, including changes in modulus, yielding, level, and the appearance of set. Additional data on sample preparation influences and PS continuity effects on sample properties were also obtained.","1988-02","2025-04-14 18:37:09","2025-04-14 18:37:09","2025-04-14 18:37:09","207-220","","4","28","","Polymer Engineering & Sci","","","","","","","","en","http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/termsAndConditions#vor","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Projected future aridity is presented based on recent studies and our analysis of model simulations. Dry periods lasting for years to decades have occurred many times during the last millennium over, for example, North America, West Africa, and East Asia. These droughts were likely triggered by anomalous tropical sea surface temperatures (SSTs), with La Niña‐like SST anomalies leading to drought in North America, and El‐Niño‐like SSTs causing drought in East China. Over Africa, the southward shift of the warmest SSTs in the Atlantic and warming in the Indian Ocean are responsible for the recent Sahel droughts. Local feedbacks may enhance and prolong drought. Global aridity has increased substantially since the 1970s due to recent drying over Africa, southern Europe, East and South Asia, and eastern Australia. Although El Niño‐Southern Oscillation (ENSO), tropical Atlantic SSTs, and Asian monsoons have played a large role in the recent drying, recent warming has increased atmospheric moisture demand and likely altered atmospheric circulation patterns, both contributing to the drying. Climate models project increased aridity in the 21               st               century over most of Africa, southern Europe and the Middle East, most of the Americas, Australia, and Southeast Asia. Regions like the United States have avoided prolonged droughts during the last 50 years due to natural climate variations, but might see persistent droughts in the next 20–50 years. Future efforts to predict drought will depend on models' ability to predict tropical SSTs.

Do they remember correctly? This essay reviews relevant empirical studies on how US newspapers have changed since the 1950s. There is strong existing evidence that journalists have come to present themselves as more aggressive, that news stories have grown longer, and that journalists are less willing to have politicians and other government officials frame stories and more likely to advance analysis and context on their own. Based on content analysis of the New York Times, Washington Post, and Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, this study finds that the growth in ‘contextual reporting’ has been enormous – from under 10 percent in all three newspapers in 1955 to about 40 percent in 2003; ‘conventional’ news stories on the front page declined from 80–90 percent in all three papers to about 50 percent in all three papers in the same period. What this study calls ‘contextual reporting’ has not been widely recognized (unlike, say, investigative reporting) as a distinctive news genre or news style and this article urges that it receive more attention.","2014-01","2025-04-14 18:37:16","2025-04-14 18:37:16","2025-04-14 18:37:16","3-20","","1","15","","Journalism","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We now report extensive premature calcification of the aorta in patients with hmzFH.                                                          Methods and Results—                              We examined 25 hmzFH patients from Canada; mean age was 32 years (range 5 to 54), and mean baseline cholesterol before treatment was 19±5 mmol/L (737±206 mg/dL). Aortic calcification was quantified using computed tomography (CT). An elevated mean calcium score was found in patients by age 20 and correlated with age (r               2               =0.53,               P               =0.001). One quarter (24%) of patients underwent aortic valve surgery.                                                          Conclusions—                              We document premature severe aortic calcifications in all adult hmzFH patients studied. These presented considerable surgical management challenges. Strategies to identify and monitor aortic calcification in hmzFH by noninvasive techniques are required, as are clinical trials to determine whether additional or more intensive therapies will prevent the progression of such calcifications. Whether vascular calcifications in hmzFH subjects are related to sustained increases in LDL-C levels or to other mechanisms, such as abnormal osteoblast activity, remains to be determined.                        ,              We examined 25 patients (mean age 32 years; range 5 to 54) with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia.

Nearly planar cyclobutanes (I–III), which were photocleaved in fluid solutions to yield acenaphthylene and 1,2-ethylenedicarboxylic acid derivatives, afford 1,8-naphthalenediacrylic acid derivatives in addition to the above products by irradiation in rigid media. Twisted cyclobutane (IV), which is considerably stable to irradiation in fluid solutions, was also photocleaved in rigid media to give dimethyl 1,8-naphthalenediacrylate. An NMR study shows that the formation of these diacrylic acid derivatives from I–IV in rigid media is considerably stereospecific. The yield ratio of diacrylic acid derivatives to acenaphthylene formed in the photolysis of I–III is independent of the viscosity of the solvents, i.e., of the matrix rigidity, but depends on other properties of the rigid solvents. A concerted mechanism is proposed for the photocleavage reaction of I–IV in rigid media in order to explain the photochemistry different from that in fluid solutions.","1976-09-01","2025-04-14 18:37:26","2025-04-14 18:37:26","2025-04-14 18:37:26","2384-2390","","9","49","","","","","","","","","","en","https://academic.oup.com/pages/standard-publication-reuse-rights","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In humans, the optimal timing of both macronutrients and its effects on glycaemic control after prolonged consumption are not studied in detail. In this cross-over trial, 29 non-obese men were randomized to two four-week diets: (1) carbohydrate-rich meals until 13.30 and fat-rich meals between 16.30 and 22.00 (HC/HF)               versus               (2) inverse sequence of meals (HF/HC). After each trial period two meal tolerance tests were performed, at 09.00 and 15.40, respectively, according to the previous intervention. On the HF/HC diet, whole-day glucose level was increased by 7.9% (p = 0.026) in subjects with impaired fasting glucose and/or impaired glucose tolerance (IFG/IGT, n = 11), and GLP-1 by 10.2% (p = 0.041) in normal glucose-tolerant subjects (NGT, n = 18). Diet effects on fasting GLP-1 (p = 0.009) and PYY (p = 0.034) levels were observed in IFG/IGT, but not in NGT. Afternoon decline of glucose tolerance was more pronounced in IFG/IGT and associated with a stronger decrease of postprandial GLP-1 and PYY levels, but not with changes of cortisol rhythm. In conclusion, the HF/HC diet shows an unfavourable effect on glycaemic control in IFG/IGT, but not in NGT subjects. Consequently, large, carbohydrate-rich dinners should be avoided, primarily by subjects with impaired glucose metabolism.","2017-03-08","2025-04-14 18:37:34","2025-04-14 18:37:34","2025-04-14 18:37:34","44170","","1","7","","Sci Rep","The effect of diurnal distribution of carbohydrates and fat on glycaemic control in humans","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\egarlock.UOTTAWA\Zotero\storage\UKHQHL9G\Kessler et al. - 2017 - The effect of diurnal distribution of carbohydrates and fat on glycaemic control in humans a random.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The aim of the present study was to investigate this in patients with generalized social anxiety disorder (SAD) using functional neuroimaging. Regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) at rest was measured twice using (99m)Tc-ECD SPECT in 10 treatment-naïve patients with SAD. In the first session, subjects were given an oral dose of CBD (400 mg) or placebo, in a double-blind procedure. In the second session, the same procedure was performed using the drug that had not been administered in the previous session. Within-subject between-condition rCBF comparisons were performed using statistical parametric mapping. Relative to placebo, CBD was associated with significantly decreased subjective anxiety ( p < 0.001), reduced ECD uptake in the left parahippocampal gyrus, hippocampus, and inferior temporal gyrus ( p < 0.001, uncorrected), and increased ECD uptake in the right posterior cingulate gyrus ( p < 0.001, uncorrected).

Certain classes of glycosaminoglycans such as chondroitin sulfate/dermatan sulfate and heparan sulfate utilize a specific tetrasaccharide linker for attachment to the protein component: GlcAβ1‐3Galβ1‐3Galβ1‐4Xylβ1‐O‐Ser. Toward understanding the conformational preferences of this linker, the present work used all‐atom explicit‐solvent molecular dynamics (MD) simulations combined with Adaptive Biasing Force (ABF) sampling to determine high‐resolution, high‐precision conformational free energy maps Δ               G               (               φ               ,               ψ               ) for each glycosidic linkage between constituent disaccharides, including the variant where GlcA is substituted with IdoA.

This is done using an analytical framework in which the CEO and other firm stakeholders interact over the firm's resource surplus as utility‐maximizing claimants based on their relative bargaining power while providing shareholders their market‐based required return. Results from the model yield a number of cogent strategic insights and predictions on the causal interplay between CEO pay, firm growth and risk characteristics, stakeholder management, corporate strategy (e.g., offshoring production), and behavioral biases such as CEO optimism and overconfidence.

Using multivariate observational models and panel data from 2014 to 2016, results suggest that the lessons of the Harry Potter series have influenced levels of opposition to punitive policies and support for tolerance of groups considered outside the American mainstream. Further, they predict public reactions to Donald Trump above and beyond their influence on policies consistent with his views.","2016-10","2025-04-14 18:37:50","2025-04-14 18:37:50","2025-04-14 18:37:50","722-729","","04","49","","APSC","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

On heating the polymer undergoes crystallisation at about 175°C. Upon melting (at 355°C) further condensation of ethyleneurea with formaldehyde takes place with elimination of water. This process overlaps with the degradation of the polymer which occurs with formation of a complex mixture of volatile products and of a charred residue. The largest fraction of the volatile products of degradation is a low boiling mixture of ethyleneurea with chain fragments containing NH, N‐methyl and unsaturated structures as end groups. A small fraction of gases such as methane, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide etc. is also evolved. A degradation mechanism is proposed, which accounts for the experimental results.","1996-01","2025-04-14 18:37:51","2025-04-14 18:37:51","2025-04-14 18:37:51","41-60","","1","197","","Macro Chemistry & Physics","","","","","","","","en","http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/termsAndConditions#vor","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A comprehensive study using X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy revealed pronounced differences of the SEI compositions at different aging stages. Both additives significantly influence the SEI composition and are able to prevent from parasitic side reactions as well as from decomposition of the conducting salt lithium hexafluorophosphate.

The FN is created by random deposition of linearly elastic straight rods within a region. The rods are bonded rigidly at contacts. Under external in-plane loading, the FN deformation consists of fiber bending, elongation, and contraction. An effective constitutive relation for fiber network is developed by averaging the strain energy dissipated by all possible fiber deformations in all directions. Numerical calculations are performed to analyze the effects of fiber aspect ratio and fiber concentration on the effective stiffness of the planar random FN. Finite element analysis (FEA) is performed and compared with the theoretical predictions of the effective FN moduli at several fiber concentrations. FEA results are in good agreement with theoretical predictions. The present model can be used for the prediction of mechanical properties, scaling analysis, and optimization of fiber assemblies.","2005-11-01","2025-04-14 18:38:15","2025-04-14 18:38:15","2025-04-14 18:38:15","093501","","9","98","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\egarlock.UOTTAWA\Zotero\storage\UILM44BT\Wu and Dzenis - 2005 - Elasticity of planar fiber networks.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Yet, such information is important for process design. In this work, continuous torque recording was found to be a suitable method to monitor the apparent viscosity. Reactions were performed in a bench scale reactor at ambient conditions with the monomer to starch ratio as the main variable. Apparent viscosity of the reaction mixture increased rapidly, which could be fitted with good accuracy with a first order exponential growth model. The maximum viscosity of 18 Pa⋅s was seen at the intermediate monomer to starch ratio of 1.0, a phenomenon that is in accordance with literature data. Starch thixotropy is influenced by the grafting of poly‐acrylic acid, until it has almost disappeared at the highest monomer to starch molar ratio of 2.0. POLYM. ENG.

Existing algorithms of risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) do not pertain to patients with familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH), whose arteries have been exposed to hypercholesterolaemia since birth. We studied a cohort of FH patients to compare four diagnostic models of CHD: traditional risk factors of CHD (age, sex, cholesterol, hypertension, smoking and body mass index), cholesterol year score, and aortic as well as coronary calcium measured by spiral computed tomography (CT).                                         Subjects.               We invited 88 individuals with molecularly defined FH of whom 80 (91%) decided to participate.                                         Results.               Analysis of receiver operating characteristic curves showed that the age‐adjusted coronary calcium score was more strongly associated with clinical manifestations of CHD than were traditional risk factors (               P                < 0.002), cholesterol year score (               P                << 0.0001), and the age‐adjusted aortic calcium score (               P                < 0.0004).                                         Conclusions.               Age‐adjusted coronary calcium score shows promise as an indicator of CHD in FH patients.","2000-04","2025-04-14 18:38:29","2025-04-14 18:38:29","2025-04-14 18:38:29","479-484","","4","247","","Journal of Internal Medicine","","","","","","","","en","http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/termsAndConditions#vor","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Background.                Chronic heart failure is a global epidemic mainly affecting an ageing population. Understanding how older people live with this disease is important to help promote their adjustment to the distressing illness experience.                                         Data sources.                Eligible studies published in 1997–2007 were identified from several databases (Medline, CINAHL, PsycINFO and Sociological Abstracts). A manual search was conducted of bibliographies of the identified studies and relevant journals.                                         Review methods.                Two researchers independently reviewed the studies and extracted the data. Key concepts from the papers were compared for similarities and differences. The transactional model of stress was used to guide data synthesis.                                         Findings.                Fourteen qualitative studies were identified. Most described the illness experiences of older people with chronic heart failure and associated coping strategies. There was some emerging work exploring the adjustment process. The findings indicated that living with chronic heart failure was characterized by distressing symptoms, compromised physical functioning, feelings of powerlessness and hopelessness, and social and role dysfunction. There were gender differences in the way the disease was conceived. Adjustment required patients to make sense of the illness experience, accept the prognosis, and get on with living with the condition.                                         Conclusion.                Empowering older people to manage chronic heart failure, instilling hope and bolstering support system are means of promoting successful adjustment to the disease. Further research needs to explore the cultural differences in the adjustment process.","2008-03","2025-04-14 18:38:46","2025-04-14 18:38:46","2025-04-14 18:38:46","474-483","","5","61","","Journal of Advanced Nursing","Living with chronic heart failure","","","","","","","en","http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/termsAndConditions#vor","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The CH chromophore spectrum is fully assigned and interpreted by means of the tridiagonal Fermi resonance Hamiltonian for the coupled CH stretching and bending vibrations. The Hamiltonian predicts and also fits the visible spectrum up to 19 000 cm−1 measured by Scherer et al., Perry et al., and Campargue et al. The effective tridiagonal Hamiltonian is derived ab initio by means of MRD-CI and full CI calculations of the potential surface of methane, a variational vibrational calculation in a normal coordinate subspace of the coupled CH stretching and bending motions and an approximate similarity transformation to tridiagonal form. Fits of the experimental results by the tridiagonal and the variational Hamiltonian lead to equivalent spectroscopic constants. A careful experimental estimate of the main Fermi resonance coupling constant gives k′sbb ≂(30±15) cm−1 in agreement with the best current ab initio result (31 cm−1). The ab initio potential in polar normal coordinates agrees with the potential derived from spectroscopic data covering an energy range of about 220 kJ mol−1 (more than half the dissociation energy). Good predictions are obtained for the parameters of the effective Hamiltonian, the spectral patterns, intensity distributions, and rotational constants in the Fermi resonance polyads. Three alternative interpretations of the parameters of the effective Hamiltonian are investigated and rejected on the basis of the available experimental and ab initio data. The results and conclusions are discussed in relation to intramolecular vibrational redistribution on the subpicosecond time scale and the recombination–dissociation kinetics of methane.","1988-05-01","2025-04-14 18:38:50","2025-04-14 18:38:50","2025-04-14 18:38:50","5408-5432","","9","88","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

GAMs possess a combination of male and female physical characteristics. Thus, GAMP presents a challenge to conventional understandings of sexual orientation as sexual attraction to the male                 v                 . female form.

Here, we investigate the effect of a random distribution of disc-shaped Al nanoantennas of different diameters deposited on Ge-on-Si PIN-photodetectors on the wavelength-dependent responsivity. We compare our experimental results to simulations and find that the largest responsivity enhancement is obtained for wavelengths that correspond to energies at or below the bandgap energy of Ge. We argue that this is the result of antenna-mediated scattering of light into waveguide modes within the Ge-on-Si PIN-photodetectors, which is effectively influenced by nanoantenna size, and we discuss a possible application of the concept for integrated biosensing.","2016-02-15","2025-04-14 18:38:54","2025-04-14 18:38:54","2025-04-14 18:38:54","071108","","7","108","","","Ge-on-Si PIN-photodetectors with Al nanoantennas","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The sensitivity of the helium solvation structure to the interaction potential is examined with calculations for two recently published He–OCS potentials, and the vibrational shift of the antisymmetric OCS vibration is estimated from a set of vibrationally adiabatic potentials.

Our objective was to quantify the acidifying effects of urea and anhydrous NH               3               when used as fertilizers for cereal production in Saskatchewan, Canada. The fertilizers were injected annually (at 10‐cm depth) into a medium‐textured, moderately acid (pH ≈5.5) Typic Haploboroll, at rates of 0, 45, 90, and 180 kg N ha               −1               for 9 yr. Soil acidity increased as N application rate increased, with anhydrous NH               3               causing greater acidification than urea. Although pH values as low as 4.3 were recorded in soil treated with anhydrous NH               3               , KCl‐exchangeable acidity remained low. The major effect of acidification was a depletion of exchangeable Ca and Mg. The solubility of Mn (but not Al) increased substantially as pH decreased, with solution concentrations of almost 30 mg Mn L               −1               being recorded 6 d after injection of NH               3               . Acidity generated by anhydrous NH               3               compared well with values predicted assuming that all of the applied NH               3               was oxidized to NO               3               −               (with the production of 1 mol H               +               mol               −1               of N) and that these protons were partly neutralized by OH               −               released when NO               3               −               was taken up and assimilated by plants.

The substituent effects on the chloride affinity of benzyl cation have been analyzed in terms of the LArSR Eq., giving a ρ = −14.0 and an r+ = 1.29. The r+ value higher than the corresponding value of unity for the α-cumyl(2-phenyl-2-propyl) cation clearly indicates that the benzyl cation has an enhanced resonance demand in the intrinsic carbocation stability compared with that of the α-cumyl one. Most importantly, the unique r+ value of 1.29 for the gas-phase benzyl cation stability has been found to be identical with the value observed for the kc ionization process of the solvolysis of the activating substituent range of benzyl tosylates. The identity of the r  + value, which is consistent with previous observations for the relevant benzylic carbocation systems, suggests that the intramolecular charge-delocalization in the transition state of the kc solvolysis should be quite close to that of the carbocation intermediates. It is concluded that the exalted r+ value observed for the kc solvolysis of benzyl tosylates is not a correlational artifact arising as a result of the non-linearity caused by the kc–ks mechanistic transition but is due to the enhanced resonance stabilization of the benzyl cation compared with the α-cumyl cation.","1995-11-01","2025-04-14 18:39:16","2025-04-14 18:39:16","2025-04-14 18:39:16","3199-3208","","11","68","","","","","","","","","","en","https://academic.oup.com/pages/standard-publication-reuse-rights","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The CLC in lying state, in both planar and twisted nematic cells, exhibits reversible in‐plane orthogonal switching of its helical axis in response to the combined effect of temperature and electric field. Consequently, the direction of the cholesteric grating has been observed to undergo 90° switching in a single cell, enabling non‐mechanical beam steering along two orthogonal directions. The ability to reversibly switch the cholesteric gartings along perpendicular directions by appropriately adjusting temperature and electric field strength could facilitate their applications in 2D beam steering, spectrum scanning, optoelectronics and beyond.","2017-06","2025-04-14 18:39:17","2025-04-14 18:39:17","2025-04-14 18:39:17","1700676","","24","29","","Advanced Materials","","","","","","","","en","http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/termsAndConditions#am","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The composite solid electrolyte exhibited excellent comprehensive performance in terms of high ionic conductivity (5.2 × 10               −4               S cm               −1               ) at 20 °C, a wide electrochemical window (4.6 V), high ionic transference number (0.75) and satisfactory mechanical strength (6.8 MPa). When evaluated as solid electrolyte for an ambient-temperature solid lithium battery, such a composite electrolyte delivered excellent rate capability (5C) at 20 °C. This superior performance can be comparable to a liquid electrolyte-soaked PP separator-based lithium battery at room temperature. To our knowledge, this is the best rate capability of a solid composite electrolyte for a solid lithium battery at ambient temperature.
